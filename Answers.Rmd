Strength of git:
It allows for version control, where the development proccess is split up into different versions, allowing for rollback onto a previous version.
It also allows for (asynchronous) collaboration with branches.

Weaknesses:
Character limit in the commit messages limits the maximum complexity of the commit
Branches, merge-conflicts, and other git aspects technically increase the complexity of the task, as it adds on top of the actual programming task.
